# Introduction


## What is an IceBreaking challenge ?
An icebreaker is an activity or game designed to welcome attendees and warm up the conversation among participants in a meeting, training class, team building session, or other activity. Any event that requires people to comfortably interact with each other and a facilitator is an opportunity to use an icebreaker...

## How we do it ?
The challenges are organized by duos at random. Once the pairs have been formed, they must call each other, choose a challenge from the proposed list, and complete the challenge within the next five minutes. Once the challange is over, the participants must return to the general discord channel and share the results with the whole class (2min per group).

## Quick note before we start
It is important to know that the goal of the exercise is not to make you uncomfortable, but on the contrary to make you feel confident. Therefore, do not share any information that could harm you in the future.

# Choose your challenge !

**Important: Please keep in mind that you have only 5 minutes to achieve the challenge, so choose your challenge as wickly as you can, so that you can spend more time one the challenge itself.**

## 10 things in common
Find 10 things you have in common with your duo. Easy cop-outs aren’t allowed, like “we both have hands”. Once you find 10 things you have in common, share your discoveries with the class. The point of this icebreaker is to help direct conversations and to find some similarities between you and your partner.

## Share a photo you are proud of
If you want to share a particular photo or an  Instagram post you're proud of? This is the perfect challenge for you! Once you have found the photo, share it via screen sharing or send the link if available online (ex. Instagram) then explain to your partner the story behind it (please keep it short)

## First jobs, worst job, dream job
The goal of this challenge is to learn a little more about your partner's professional experience. If you have one or more professional experience, choose between the first and the worst professional experience and explain it to your partner. If you've never had professional experience before, tell your partner about your dream job.

## Two truths, one lie
Two truths, one lie is one of our favourites each person lists off two truths about themselves and one lie. The truths and lies can be anything or be restricted to a theme, the choice is yours. One after another, the group will decide what the two truths are and which one is a lie. It’s great fun, especially if participants include something funny that has happened to them in the past.

## Would you rahter ?
"Would you rather" is a conversation that poses a dilemma in the form of a question beginning with "would you rather". Here are some examples :
- Would you rather go into the past and meet your ancestors or go into the future and meet your great-great grandchildren?
-  Would you rather have more time or more money?
-  Would you rahter lose your teeth or lose your hair ?
-  would you rather get married to someone rich and ugly or someone poor but beautiful?
-  Would you rather be without internet for a week, or without your phone?
-  Would you rather be stuck on an island alone or with someone who talks incessantly?

Do not hesitate to invent your own question !

## One question to hire a candidate

Imagine that you are working for a company that need to hire a person for a particular job (whatever the job may be). As a hiring manager, you can only ask one single question to determine whether or not the candidate is suitable for the job. What would be that question ? Of course, the partner must anwser the question as if his life depended on it.

For this challenge each player must play the role of the hiring manager and the candidate.
